    "1) Decision Trees - \"a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are good for classification so it suits my needs.  Secondly, we have broken nearly every label into basically binary decisions and Decision Trees seems very convenient for this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are used in real world for numerous applications.  One application for decision trees is in biomedical engineering.  Decision trees were used for identifying features to be used in implantable devices as seen in this reference: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8258439\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following link shows numerous applications in which decisions trees are used: http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/~salzberg/docs/murthy_thesis/survey/node32.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\"Simple to understand and to interpret. Trees can be visualised.\n",
    "The cost of using the tree (i.e., predicting data) is logarithmic in the number of data points used to train the tree.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem does not have a lot of data points, so it is beneficial to have a learning algorithm that does not need a lot of points for training. Also, our features are somewhat binary, so the vizualation is pretty to easy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "SKLEARN DOC: \"Decision-tree learners can create over-complex trees that do not generalise the data well. This is called overfitting. Mechanisms such as pruning (not currently supported), setting the minimum number of samples required at a leaf node or setting the maximum depth of the tree are necessary to avoid this problem.\n",
    "Decision tree learners create biased trees if some classes dominate. It is therefore recommended to balance the dataset prior to fitting with the decision tree.\n",
    "Decision trees can be unstable because small variations in the data might result in a completely different tree being generated. This problem is mitigated by using decision trees within an ensemble.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "These are all valid things to worry about.  Therefore, I need to keep these in mind when finalizing my data. Specifically overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Ensemble Method (AdaBoost) - \"The core principle of AdaBoost is to fit a sequence of weak learners (i.e., models that are only slightly better than random guessing, such as small decision trees) on repeatedly modified versions of the data. The predictions from all of them are then combined through a weighted majority vote (or sum) to produce the final prediction.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "My first reason for using this classifier is I really enjoyed the class and liked the part about how Ensemble Learning with boost give us a very good chance of not overfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "My second reason is for using AdaBoost is I find this problem very similar to the spam issue we discussed in class.  What are some rules that work with a set of students and what rules work with another.  We do not have a lot of data points, but we have a lot of features.  So lets make rules on some features to prevent the curse of dimensionality and then combine those rules decide which kids need help.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble Learning has been used in the real world. \"Ensemble learning is just a way of combining the output of multiple models in order to get a better result. This is a cheap way of improving your model, so i would bet that most real world applications use some sort of ensemble.\n",

    "Here is a portion from that winning paper:\n",
    "\"Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT) are an additive regression model consisting of an ensemble of trees, fitted to current residuals in a forward step-wise manner. In the traditional boosting framework, the weak learners are generally shallow decision trees consisting of a few leaf nodes.

    "3) Support Vector Machines - \"SVMs are a set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression, and outlier detection.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated above, I am looking at this problem as a classification problem so this learning method works.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have found a few examples of SVM used in the real world.  One example: \"Protein remote homology detection is a central problem in computational biology. Supervised learning algorithms based on support vector machines are currently one of the most effective methods for remote homology detection. The performance of these methods depends on how the protein sequences are modeled and on the method used to compute the kernel function between them.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "I thought this was interesting because I have never heard of a homology before. BTW, Homology is similarity in sequence of a protein or nucleic acid between organisms of the same or different species.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mores examples of how SVMs are used in the real world can be found here: http://www.clopinet.com/SVM.applications.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages\n",
    "SKLEARN DOC: \"Effective in high dimensional spaces.\n",
    "Still effective in cases where number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.\n",
    "Uses a subset of training points in the decision function (called support vectors), so it is also memory efficient.\n",
    "Versatile: different Kernel functions can be specified for the decision function. Common kernels are provided, but it is also possible to specify custom kernels.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated in the documentation, this learning method is good for high dimensional spaces.  This seems appropriate since we have such a large number of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages or as I like to call them, \"Things to worry about\":\n",
    "CLASS NOTES: \"Sometimes with a lot of data, SVMs (out of the box) might be slow and could overfit.\n",
    "SVMs don't work well with lots and lots of noise, so when the classes are overlapping, I have to count independent evidence.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "For us, I do not think we have a lot of noise nor is our particular data set really big.\n",
    "\n",

    "A support vector machine is a supervised learning model that involves trying to split data up into groups (or classes).  It does this by splitting the data with a line (2D) or plane (3D-know as a hyperplane).  This hyperplane is trying to find the location that provides the most space between different groups, known as the *maximum-margin* line.  This line is in the middle of the two groups and it works well because it allows for noise or mistakes in the data.  It should be noted that the larger the margin, the better chance the learning model will not overfit the data.  Please see figure below for what a hyperplane will look like when splitting up the data.  There is two data classes in the figure below: blue circles and red squares.\n"

    "This is when the SVM uses what is called the Kernel Trick.  The Kernel Trick looks at the data from another dimension (this case the third) and it can be seen that some data is clustered higher and some data is clustered together in the lower section.  This will allow for a hyperplane to be drawn between the data and separate it accordingly.  As seen in the final image."
